A page with comments consists of a list of comments and a form for posting new comment. This is it's HTML code:

<ul id='commentList'>
</ul>
<form>
  <input type='text' id='comment'/>
  <input type='button' id='postComment' value='Post'/>
</form>
Write a registerClickHandler function that registers click handler and implements the following logic:

When button with id postComment is clicked, new <li> element should be added to the bottom of the list with id commentList, containing the value of the text field with id comment.
If the text field is empty, comment should not be posted.
The value of the text field should be cleared after the comment has been posted.
For example, after the comment "test" has been posted, lists's HTML code should look like this:

<ul id='commentList'>
  <li>test</li>
</ul>
